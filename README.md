# Data Science Utilities Updated by Celerik (Originally created by Microsoft TDSP Team)

[**Interactive Data Exploration, Analysis, and Reporting (IDEAR) in Python**](DataScienceUtilities/DataReport-Utils/Python)

This repository contains a set of **Data Science Utilities** originally developed for use in the context of the [Team Data Science Process (TDSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) by Microsoft. Celerik has updated these utilities to support the latest Python versions and integrated Voilà for an enhanced visualization experience. This repository is intended only to support only the python version of the IDEAR, so R and MRS are excluded from the repo.

## Release Notes

This is a release of the Data Science Utilities for TDSP, updated by Celerik. We have focused on the Python version of IDEAR, ensuring compatibility with the latest Python versions and enhancing the user experience with Voilà for interactive visualizations.

Currently, the Data Science Utility released in this repository includes:

- [Interactive Data Exploration, Analysis, and Reporting (IDEAR) in Python](DataScienceUtilities/DataReport-Utils/Python).

You can easily run this utility on sample data in the **Data/Common** directory that comes from the original repo.
